🫁 Synthetic Asthma Dataset Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes a synthetic asthma dataset using Python tools like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. The aim is to:

Understand patterns and correlations among features.

Identify the most relevant predictors of asthma.

Clean and preprocess the data.

Build predictive machine learning models.

🗂️ Dataset Information
The dataset is synthetic and simulates patient data with attributes that may influence asthma prevalence. Key features include:

Demographics (Age, Gender, etc.)

Environmental exposures (Air Quality Index, Pollution Level)

Lifestyle (Smoking, Physical Activity)

Medical history and symptoms

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Steps performed:

Handling missing values using median and mode.

Encoding categorical variables.

Outlier detection and treatment.

Feature scaling (if necessary for specific models).

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations and statistical summaries were used to:

Examine distribution of individual features.

Understand correlations with Has_Asthma label.

Identify multicollinearity between features.

Tools used:

Seaborn for count plots and correlation heatmaps.

Matplotlib for bar and line plots.

🤖 Machine Learning Models
Several classification models were applied:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest

KNN

Support Vector Mechanism

Model performance evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC (if applicable)

📈 Key Findings
Certain features like Air Pollution, Smoking, and Family History are strongly correlated with asthma.

Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed better than others in terms of predictive power.

📦 Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn


📚 Future Improvements
Apply hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV).

Use cross-validation for more robust results.

Explore deep learning models for classification.
